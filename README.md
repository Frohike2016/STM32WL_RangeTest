# STM32WL_RangeTest
LoRa range test firmware for STM32WL Nucleo module (STM32WL55JC - M4 + M0 + sx1262). It will use Waveshare 1.54Inch E-Paper screen to show the last packet received (with RSSI) for each radio module. We are going to compare Murata typeABZ (STM32L071 + sx1276), STM32WL Nucleo module and RAK3172 (STM32WLE5CC- M4 + sx1262)
